# SOCRATES

**SOCRATES** is a unified platform for neural network verification developed by Sun Jun's team at SMU.

Unlike most existing approaches which are scattered (i.e., each approach tackles some restricted classes of neural networks against certain particular properties), incomparable (i.e., each approach has its own assumptions and input format) and thus hard to apply, reuse or extend. **SOCRATES** aims at providing a unified platform for neural network verificaiton via supporting a standardized format for a variety of neural network models, an asseration language for property specification as well as two novel algorithms for verifying or falsifying neural network models.

## Installation:

```
virtualenv -p python3 socrates_venv
